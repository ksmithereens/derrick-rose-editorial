        <p>2013–14 season: Return and Torn Meniscus</p>
        <p>After missing the entire 2012-2013 season, his first official game was in 107–95 loss against the defending champions Miami Heat on October 29. Rose was limited to 12 points, while having 4 assists in 34 minutes of play. He wasn't playing well, but was able to make it through the each game. <br>
          On November 22, Rose injured his right knee during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers. 
          An MRI the next day confirmed that Rose tore his right knee meniscus and that surgery was required. <br>
          On November 25, Rose underwent surgery on the torn meniscus in his right knee.
          The same day, the Bulls announced Rose was out for the season, after a successful surgery.</p>
        <p>2014-2015: Back To The Playoffs</p>
        <p>Rose returned from injury to play in the Bulls' season opener against the New York Knicks on October 29, 2014, and recorded 13 points and 5 assists in 21 minutes of action. He went on to score a season-high 32 points on January 14 against the Washington Wizards,[98] before being ruled out again with another knee injury a month later. 
          He appeared in 51 games, the most he'd played since the 2010–11 season.[99]
          On February 24, it was announced Rose required another round of surgery on his right knee and was ruled out indefinitely. An exam and subsequent MRI confirmed a medial meniscus tear of the right knee, the same injury he sustained on November 22, 2013, against the Portland Trail Blazers.[100][101] On February 27, he was deemed a possibility of returning toward the end of the season after he underwent successful surgery and was ruled out for just four to six weeks.[102]
          Rose returned to action on April 8 after a 20-game absence, and working on a minutes restriction, he was 3-of-9 from the field and finished with nine points in 19 minutes as the Bulls lost to the Orlando Magic.[103]
          On April 18, Rose played in his first playoff game since Game 1 of the 2012 playoffs (the game where he tore his left ACL). Rose finished with 23 points and 7 assists on 9-of-16 shooting.[104] During the Bulls' first round series against the Bucks, Rose averaged 21.5 points per game. On May 8, Rose banked in a three-pointer at the buzzer and scored 30 points to give the Bulls a 99–96 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers and a 2–1 lead in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.[105] However, the Cavaliers won the final three games to take the series in six games.</p>
        <p>2015-2016: Final Season With The Bulls</p>
        <p>A preseason left orbital bone fracture saw Rose begin the regular season wearing a face mask.[106] On November 5, 2015, Rose scored a then season-high 29 points on 12-of-25 shooting in a 104–98 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. He showed signs of his old MVP self as he scored 10 points over the final three and a half minutes to lift the Bulls after they blew a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter.[107] On December 18, he scored a season-high 34 points in a 147–144 quadruple overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons.[108] On February 5, 2016, he had a season-best game with 30 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists in a 115–110 loss to the Denver Nuggets.[109]</p>

          He returned to working with the Cavaliers' medical staff in early December in hopes of recovering from a sprained left ankle and bone spurs.[121] 
          On January 18, 2018, Rose returned to the line-up after missing more than two months with ankle injuries and scored nine points in 13 minutes in a 104–103 win over the Orlando Magic.[122]</p>

        <p>2018–2019: Minnesota Timberwolves</p>
        <p>On February 8, 2018, Rose was acquired by the Utah Jazz in a three-team trade that also involved the Cavaliers and the Sacramento Kings.[123] Two days later, he was waived by the Jazz.[124]
          On March 8, 2018, Rose signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves,[125] reuniting him with Tom Thibodeau, Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson. In the playoffs, Rose averaged 14.2 points in 23.8 minutes per game, as the Timberwolves lost 4–1 to the Houston Rockets in the first round.[126] His best performance of the series came on April 24, 2018 in Game 5, as he scored 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting, including 2-of-2 for three in 32 minutes; however the Rockets won 119–100 after outscoring the Timberwolves 50–20 in the third quarter which Rose started on the bench.[127]
          On July 4, 2018, Rose re-signed with the Timberwolves for the 2018–19 season.[128] On October 31, in his first start of the season, Rose scored a career-high 50 points in a 128–125 win over the Utah Jazz, securing the victory with a block on Utah's final shot as time expired.[129] On November 8, he recorded 31 points in a 114–110 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, hitting a career-best 7 three pointers from 9 attempts.[130] On December 26, Rose had 24 points and eight assists and received MVP chants in a 119–94 win over the Bulls in Chicago. It was only his second career game in the United Center against his former team.[131] On January 15, 2019, against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rose reached 10,000 career points.[132] On January 20, he scored 29 of his 31 points in the second half and hit an 18-footer with 0.6 seconds left to give the Timberwolves a 116–114 victory over the Phoenix Suns.[133] Right ankle trouble saw Rose miss 11 of 19 games spanning late December to late January.[134] He missed an additional three games in early February.[135] On March 21, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a right elbow injury.[136] Rose ended the season with 18.0 points and 4.3 assists per game with a career-high 37% field goal percentage for three pointers. However, the Timberwolves missed the playoffs, as they ended the season with a 36-46 record, enough only for the 11th spot in the Western Conference.</p>

        <p>2019-2021: Detroit Pistons</p>
        <p>On July 7, 2019, Rose signed with the Detroit Pistons.[137] On October 23, he made his debut for the Pistons, logging 18 points, three rebounds, and nine assists in a 119–110 win over the Indiana Pacers.[138] On December 9, Rose scored the game winner in a 105–103 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, hitting a buzzer beater with a close range fadeaway jumper against Jrue Holiday. Rose scored 17 out of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, where he shot 7-of-8 from the field, including two three pointers from two attempts.[139] On December 15, in the 115–107 win against the Houston Rockets, he had a double-double with 20 points and 12 assists, scoring ten points in the final quarter.[140]
          Rose became the first player in Pistons history to record seven consecutive 20+ point games as a reserve, which also coincided with his career-high 14-game streak of scoring 20 points or more.[141] The most notable games in the streak included a 116–103 win over the Boston Celtics on January 15, 2020, in which Rose scored 22 points on 11-of-13 shooting,[142] followed by a 136–103 win against the Atlanta Hawks three days later, with 27 points and 9 assists.[143] The streak ended after he suffered a groin injury during a game with the Denver Nuggets.[144] During the month of January when he accomplished the feat, Rose averaged 22 points, six assists and three rebounds, while shooting 51% from the floor.[145] In his third game after returning from injury, Rose scored a season-high 31 points en route to a win against the Phoenix Suns.[146][147] Despite a strong individual season by Rose as the team's sixth man, the Pistons ended the season at the 13th place in the Eastern Conference with a disappointing 20-46 record, having struggled without their best player Blake Griffin, who featured in only 15 games due to injuries.</p>

        <p>On February 8, 2021, Rose was traded back to the New York Knicks for Dennis Smith Jr. and a 2021 second-round draft pick, once again reuniting him with coach Tom Thibodeau and former teammate Taj Gibson.[148] Rose made his return debut on February 20 in a 98–96 loss against the Miami Heat, in which he provided an immediate offensive spark for the Knicks, scoring 14 points and dishing three assists.[149] He peaked in May, scoring 25 points on 11-of-15 shooting in the 118–104 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on May 4,[150] and equalling that tally while adding eight assists six days later in a 106–100 win against the Los Angeles Clippers.[151] On May 12, in an overtime loss against the Los Angeles Lakers, he recorded a season-high 27 points with 6 assists and 6 rebounds.[152] Rose was a major contributor coming from the bench, helping the Knicks finish fourth in the East and placing third in the Sixth Man of the Year voting.[153]
          On May 24, 2021, in his first playoff game since 2018, Rose had 17 points, five assists and five rebounds off the bench as the Knicks lost to the Atlanta Hawks 107–105.[154] In Game 2, coach Thibodeau put Rose in the starting unit for the second half after initially being on the bench, and he responded with a game-high 26 points for the Knicks, leading his team to a 101–92 win to even the series.[155] On May 28, during Game 3 of the Knicks' first round series against the Atlanta Hawks, Rose made his first playoff start since the 2015 conference semifinals, recording a season-high 30 points, as well as six rebounds and five assists, in a 105–94 loss as Atlanta took a 2–1 series lead.[156] The Hawks went on to win the series 4–1, as Rose suffered a knee injury in the closing of the series.[157]
